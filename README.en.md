# typera branch

## Overview

This repository is a branch of my personal learning repository **Typera** (==Typera software==), which mainly includes basic markdown syntax, software specific features encountered during the use of Typera, and personal Typera topics written by referring to the API manual on the official website and other Typera software topics.
This repository uses **MIT License**, and you can download and use it yourself if needed.

## Branch directory and file description

### Directory “css-style” is the software theme directory.

The software theme in the directory "lower-style" only rewrites the basic markup syntax to render the displayed style in the software.

Directory "upper-style" is based on the "lower style" theme style, rewriting the background style after Typera starts, and converting the fonts used in the theme style to base64 format to ensure that Typera does not lose fonts during rendering.
